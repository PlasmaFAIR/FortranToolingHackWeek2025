# Code of Conduct

We will be following the code of conduct of the Society of Research Software Engineering,
which is licensed under a Creative Commons 4.0 license. The 'short version' is reproduced
with minor alterations below, while the full text may be found

## The Short Version

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that
harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many
different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex,
age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and parenthood,
race, religion or belief (or lack thereof), gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
technical choices, experience level or any other dimension of diversity. We do not tolerate
harassment of community members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
