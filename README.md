# Fortran Tooling Hack Week 2025

This repository contains resources for the Fortran Tooling Hack Week taking place between May
27th and May 30th 2025.

Building upon the success of the [Back to the Fortran Future](https://lu.ma/ao471jms) event at
[RSECon 2024](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/), we're aiming to make contributions to the
open-source Fortran tooling ecosystem. This includes testing frameworks, documentation
generators, linters, debuggers, and more. Participation in this event will be flexible --
whether you can spare just an hour per day or want to contribute more, you're welcome to join.

The hack week will begin with short project pitches, after which attendees will be encouraged
to form teams. A dedicated Slack space will be provided to help coordinate activities, though
teams are welcome to use any communication tool they prefer. Throughout the week, we'll host
optional morning stand-up sessions for teams to share progress and raise any blockers, along
with afternoon check-in and co-working sessions, where attendees can collaborate and support
each other. The project organisers [@LiamPattinson](https://github.com/LiamPattinson) and
[@ZedThree](https://github.com/ZedThree) will be available at these sessions to help
troubleshoot any issues that arise.

While we would recommend attending each meeting, we understand that this may not always be
feasible. We will therefore make accommodations where possible, and no single meeting will be
mandatory, including the introduction, project pitches, and closing presentations. Recordings
will be made available for those who can't make the project pitches.
